Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 3.0
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = 6.664001874625058e-8
Variance:                  V = 8.881784197001254e-15
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = NaN
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = inf

Computing probabilities up to 4...
p(0) = 0.0
p(1) = 0.0
p(2) = 0.0
p(3) = 1.0
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 4
