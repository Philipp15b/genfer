Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 4.0
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = 8.161702118890974e-8
Variance:                  V = 1.332267629550188e-14
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = NaN
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = inf

Computing probabilities up to 5...
p(0) = 0.0
p(1) = 0.0
p(2) = 0.0
p(3) = 0.0
p(4) = 1.0
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 5
