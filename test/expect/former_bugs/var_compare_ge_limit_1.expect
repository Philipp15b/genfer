Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 7}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 0.3125
Expected value:            E = 1.0
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = 1.0
Variance:                  V = 1.0
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 0.5999999999999992
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 2.1999999999999966

Computing probabilities up to 1...
Unnormalized: p(0)     = 0.125
Normalized:   p(0) / Z = 0.4
Unnormalized: p(n)     <= 0.18750000000000003 for all n >= 1
Normalized:   p(n) / Z <= 0.6000000000000002 for all n >= 1
