Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 0.9
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = 0.30000000000000004
Variance:                  V = 0.09000000000000002
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = -2.6666666666666616
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 8.111111111111057

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 0.1
p(1) = 0.9
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 2
