Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 1.0
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = 1.7473160325823093e-8
Variance:                  V = 6.106226635438362e-16
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = NaN
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = inf

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 0.0
p(1) = 1.0
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 2
